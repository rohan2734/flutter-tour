rename the stateless widget to statefull

statefull widget is combinatio of 2 classes

make a new class with the content

now tell that the , new class should belong to MyApp

State is a generic, so add a pointer, so we connect from one end, that State is part of myApp
second connection:
and we add from MyApp that
we have to add a new method, createState method

it is a method, that returns a state object, that is connected to a stateful widget 
so we return  a myappstate object
we have override, because createState, isa method provieded by statefulwidget


 why we have 2 classes:
 widget can be recreated,
 when external data, changes it is recreated
 while state, is persistent, it is not recreated, it is important for storing the data,


here flutter wont rerender after each touch, it iwll only rerender, when we wrap it under a setSTate function
setSTate is a method, it takes another function, and we move the code there
