In general  : State is data used by our app

In app state: authenticated users, loaded jobs

 Widget state :current User input  is a loading spinner shown

 here the stateless widget also matters and Text is a stateless widget

 some widgets have to change the state, now we can change the stateless widget to statefull widget

 difference:
 stateless
 we cant pass data from outside into the stateless widget through the constructor of the class
 flutter would rebuild ,when external data changes, but inside of the widget class, will not change

 statefull
 we can pass data from outside to statefull using constructor, and it will also have the state
 it will get rerednered whenever, external input change, or input state change
